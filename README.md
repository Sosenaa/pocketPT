# PocketPT

PocketPT is an AI-powered personal training web app that generates personalised workout plans based on a user's goals, body data, activity level, and training environment.

Users can register, log in, enter their training details, generate a plan with AI, view their workouts, log exercise performance, and track simple training stats through a dashboard.

   - age
   - weight
   - height
   - gender
   - goal
   - activity level
   - training environment
3. The backend sends this information to the OpenAI API.

6. The frontend fetches and displays the latest saved plan.
7. The user can log exercise performance and track progress.
